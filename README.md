# Memory Card Game Challenge

Welcome to the **Memory Card Game Challenge**! This repository contains the code for a memory card game, and it's the starting point for a live coding challenge. Participants will be tasked with implementing the functionality to play this memory card game within a specific time frame.

## Overview

In this challenge, participants will need to complete the functionality of the **Memory Card Game** using the provided starter code. The goal of the game is to match pairs of cards in the shortest number of moves. The game has several levels, and the player must match all pairs before the time runs out.

This repository includes the basic structure of the game, including the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Participants are required to implement the necessary logic to make the game functional.

## Objective

The primary objective of this challenge is for participants to:
1. Complete the missing functionality of the game.
2. Implement a memory card game that allows players to interact with cards and match them.
3. Create a smooth user experience that includes animations, feedback, and game status indicators (e.g., moves, time, and win conditions).

## How to Play

1. The game consists of 16 cards, each with an image.
2. Each card is placed face down, and the player must flip two cards at a time to try to match pairs.
3. If the cards match, they stay face up; if they don't, they flip back face down.
4. The player wins when all pairs are matched within the given time limit.
5. The game tracks the number of moves and the time taken to complete the game.

## Requirements

- **HTML**: The structure of the game board and layout.
- **CSS**: Styling for the game, including card visuals and animations.
- **JavaScript**: The functionality for flipping cards, tracking moves, and managing game logic.

## Challenge Guidelines

- **Start by cloning this repository**: Fork and clone this repository to get started.
- **Work on the missing functionality**: The main game logic is missing, and you need to implement it.
- **Submit your solution**: Once your solution is ready, submit it via the GitHub submission link provided during the challenge.

## How to Run the Game Locally
